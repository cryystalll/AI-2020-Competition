* Deep Learning Classifier : CNN & VGG
* Machine Learning : Ensemble Learning
* Using Tensorflow backend. Sometimes we use Keras, which is the core of Tensorflow.
* Workflow summary: 
* Mounting -> Basic I/O and labeling
* -> Classifier 1 -> Reading Demo Image
* -> Classifier 2 -> Classifier 3 -> Ensemble learning
* -> Reading GAN A/B/C to train models 1, 2 and 3 (optional)
* The output of the labeling process: filenames and the grades of the mangoes presented in Capitalized letters.
